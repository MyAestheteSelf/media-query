            Sometimes things work out, but just contrary to what you wanted and that's okay. How many stories have we read where an engineer becomes an actor, a dancer, or a writer? Many. Most of us would have at least heard one of such a kind. 
            
            <p>
            <img src="1.jpeg" alt="">I have always wondered how people were able to just make instant decisions and "follow their gut". Through all these times, I have been extremely planned about whatever I do. To the extent that along with planning my days, I would even plan my conversations in bullet points. 
            However, as I write this today, I just know two things:
            I will make the posts as relevant, backed by research and helpful as I can,
            I will post on a regular basis.
            I am a Psychology student and will be posting blogs in a series.</p>
            
            <p>
            For example, 
            one that discusses the psychological point of view, 
            common layman points of view and researches that may/may not support the views, 
            how each and every field can be easily connected to psychology and 
            how basic knowledge of psychology is beneficial for overall improvement of relationships and more productive and healthier lives.</p>

            <p>
            I do not have a written fool-proof plan about this blogging endeavor, but I hope, for once, that things will work out even without it. Through my blog, I just know that I am here to take you along with me on a journey, not to a physical place, but to a knowledge-packed, psychological one, with only one aim, only one destination: becoming our personal satisfactory best. The world does not have to be satisfied and other peopleâ€™s opinions are not a blueprint for where you reach, or where I do. We should feel better, more empowered and not limited to the confines of some cultural or traditional boundary.</p>
