            I once told my friend how there was beauty even in broken things.He didn’t believe me at first but then I explained:
            Oh, how we refer to things that break,including our heart! (not quite literally though). We refer to them as objects worth pity in the case of people, as if they always need our support. What we don’t notice is how the break is from within and we can be there, but not put the pieces together and make it whole again.Sometimes our sympathetic nature can slow the healing process of the person as it puts him in the role of a person who needs constant care and pity.It may aggravate victim mentality and completely abdicate any sense of responsibility that the person has.Our concern then,creates a very  negative effect, one we don’t anticipate.Also, while we refer to these objects and people we use a plethora of words like demolished, destructed, in ruins, ruptured, shattered, mutilated,fragmented, fractured, crushed, dismembered, in pieces, and the list goes on.
            While we enjoy some of the demolished ruins and even express joy at the finding of another piece of history through architecture or artifacts,I notice that we don’t do the same with people. We don’t see the beauty of how the breakage may change them, how it may transform them to be open, more reflective. If there’s  a crack, that means new light can get in. So heartbreaks,and other serious life events that may leave you hurt aren’t a damage; they are building a new you. 

            We all know about ROME.The greatest empire in history with great rulers,ploytheistic society and amazing architectural work.
            Rome has a massive stone structure believed to be used as an open amphitheater for games and entertainment including Gladiatorial combats and wild animal fights: THE COLOSSEUM. It is broken, yet beautiful. It speaks of the time that was and gives us the testimony that even the most grand structures  can break down and stand strong against the passage of time, a proof that things break yet sometimes don’t fall. They are transient and yet surpass other structures, broken yet firmly standing their ground, intact.

            They are my strength. Broken, but beautiful.

            In the end, it depends on how we see broken things.Either as objects worth pity or wastage  or as objects that may take another form.By using the previously mentioned spectrum of words for the breakage we define the current state of the thing, re-emphasizing on how each thing is at one given point of time. What we miss while we describe their state is what they may turn into, the capacity to transform if not for our words of pity and sometimes ridicule.
            The effect those few words can create negatively,can be reversed if we use a more positive approach just like the historians. We know about the story that the person has to tell, the glorious past, the ruined present and the hopeful future.Few words of comfort and strength can help them more than our sympathy.

            So why not choose to be a bit more optimistic with our words too!
            Remember:
            Words are a free commodity but it’s your use that may decide their value.
            
            Studies show that individuals who view mental illness with pity experience negative self- and other-effects of stigma.These effects persist even after 6 months. Imagine the effect of constant self pity due to the view of a person’s self worth, self esteem after a devastating incident.
